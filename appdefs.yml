      - title: CloudBerry Backup Web Interface
        level: 2
        content: |-
          CloudBerry Backup provides its own web interface.  It can be accessed
          via HTTP port 43210 and/or HTTPs port 43211.
      - title: Credentials
        level: 3
        content: |-
          A username and password must be configured before being able to login to the web interface.

          The username is set via the `CBB_WEB_INTERFACE_USER` environment variable.

          There are two ways of setting the password:
            - Via the `CBB_WEB_INTERFACE_PASSWORD` environment variable.
            - By storing the password hash in `/config/.cbb_web_interface_pass_hash`
              (container path).

          The password hash can be generated by the command `mkpasswd`.  For example, to
          generate the hash using the SHA-512 method:
          ```
          mkpasswd -m sha-512
          ```

          The whole output of the command must be saved into
          `/config/.cbb_web_interface_pass_hash`.  Here is an example of the output:
          ```
          $6$VkhGUiCpmE$Mqm8k4oBKF0O4gqstzUvq32FJ3nxgAMjyhqbESCPj8nqSvcQoZw4d/U.oQYN/rsh4FonIoPjsvOn/WQSG84RE/
          ```

          An other way of generating the password hash is to set the password in
          clear-text in `/config/.cbb_web_interface_clear_text_pass`.  When the container
          starts, a hash is performed using the content of this file and is automatically
          saved to `/config/.cbb_web_interface_pass_hash`.  Then, the clear-text password
          file is deleted.
