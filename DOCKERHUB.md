## Quick Start

**NOTE**:
    The Docker command provided in this quick start is given as an example
    and parameters should be adjusted to your need.

Launch the MSP360 Backup docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=cloudberry-backup \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/cloudberry-backup:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user:/storage:ro \
    jlesage/cloudberry-backup
```

Where:

  - `/docker/appdata/cloudberry-backup`: This is where the application stores its configuration, states, log and any files needing persistency.
  - `/home/user`: This location contains files from your host that need to be accessible to the application.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the MSP360 Backup GUI.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.
